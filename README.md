# Card Picking Game ðŸŽ´  

A simple and interactive multiplayer card game written in C++! The goal is to achieve the highest score without exceeding 21. This project demonstrates the use of core programming concepts like arrays, structures, file handling, and interactive user input.

## Features  
- **Multiplayer Gameplay**: Supports 2 to 4 players.  
- **Optional Computer Player**: Includes an AI-controlled computer player.  
- **Dynamic Deck Management**: A shuffled 52-card deck ensures variety in every round.  
- **Score Calculation**: Automatically calculates scores with special handling for Aces.  
- **Save & Load**: Save the game progress to a file and resume it anytime.  
- **Round & Overall Winners**: Displays winners for each round and the overall game.  
- **ASCII Card Display**: Visual representation of cards using ASCII art.

## How to Play  
1. Enter the number of players (2 to 4) and their names.  
2. Each player takes turns drawing cards.  
3. Try to score as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it.

- A C++ compiler (e.g., `g++`).  

### Steps  
1. Clone this repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/card-picking-game.git
   cd card-picking-game
   ```  
2. Compile the code:

## Learning Outcomes  
This project is a great way to practice:  
- Arrays and data structures (e.g., `Card` and `Player`).  
- File handling using `ifstream` and `ofstream`.  
- Randomization for shuffling the deck.  
- User interaction and validation.
